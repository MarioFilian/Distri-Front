# Distri-Front
# Distributed Programming - In-Class Workshop

This is a simple front-end project created as part of an **in-class workshop** for the **Distributed Programming** course.

## 💻 Description

The front-end includes a basic interface featuring:

- A **title** labeled "Distribuida"
- Two **buttons arranged in a row** inside a centered container
- Light blue **background**
- Each button redirects to a different external URL

🔁 **The front-end serves as a redirect gateway to 4 deployed platforms:**

- 🌐 [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- 🌐 [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- 🌐 [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- 🌐 [Railway](https://railway.app/)

> The actual URLs can be updated in the `script.js` file to point to apps deployed on those platforms.
